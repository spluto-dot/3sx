# Inspired by https://github.com/ethteck/kh1/blob/main/tools/sym2pcsx2.py

# A simple tool that reads the symbol_addrs.txt file produced by splat
# and generates a .sym file for use with the PCSX2 emulator's debugger.

# NOTE: The generated .sym file MUST be in the EXACT same directory and have
# the EXACT same name as the .iso being used in PCSX2 for the emulator
# to detect it. For example, the sym file generated to accompany
# `Roms/SFIII.iso` MUST be named/stored as `Roms/SFIII.sym`
